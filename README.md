# Fithaus Website
This website is designed for Jorge Barajas, owner of Fithaus gym in Mazamitla, Mexico. The website is a single page application built to persuade potential new members to sign up for a membership, and the page allows potential members to learn about Fithaus' story, membership pricing, services, and location.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** JavaScript (React, Motion), CSS (Tailwind), HTML

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized the React library for modern, component-based architecture. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS for a consistent and clean design across all devices. To enhance user engagement, I used Motion to add fast and stiff animations to convey Fithaus' aesthetic and brand. The result is a modern and lightweight website that presents key information clearly and encourages visitors to sign up.

## Lessons Learned
This project was my first step into freelance web development. I did extensive community service in college and I wanted to continue to contribute a positive impact to my local community, so I decided to create websites for local businesses to help them build an online presence. In preparation for this project, I taught myself React, Motion, and Tailwind CSS from zero knowledge. I also taught myself safe practices when using API keys, and did extensive research on which APIs to use to not only increase user engagement, but to also guarantee no overhead expenses to the owner. I also learned to use gh-pages to deploy the project, and since the project does not need to make any calls to a database nor profit directly from the website, CMS is handled for free according to Github Pages terms and agreements.
